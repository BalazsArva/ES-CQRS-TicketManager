# ES-CQRS-TicketManager
A demo ticket manager app which I develop to study and experiment with event sourcing and CQRS.

The app is a simplified ticket manager with which users (no authentication planned for now) can create tickets such as tasks and bugs, provide them with details, assign priorities, make state transitions, comment on them and link them to each other.
